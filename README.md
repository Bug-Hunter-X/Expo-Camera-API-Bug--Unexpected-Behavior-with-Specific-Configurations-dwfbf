# Expo Camera API Bug: Unexpected Behavior with Specific Configurations

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with certain configurations. The bug leads to unexpected behavior, including crashes, when specific settings are applied.

## Bug Description
The issue arises from improper handling of permissions or camera settings within the Expo Camera API. This is particularly noticeable when using specific flash modes, aspect ratios, or camera types. The exact conditions that trigger the bug may vary depending on the device and Expo SDK version.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app: `expo start`
4. Observe the unexpected behavior or crash when interacting with the camera (e.g., changing flash mode or switching camera types).

## Solution
The solution involves carefully handling camera permissions and ensuring the correct configuration of the camera settings. It might also require error handling to gracefully manage cases where the requested camera settings are unavailable. This can include using async/await for permission handling, checking camera capabilities, and implementing fallback mechanisms. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` for implementation details.

## Additional Notes
This bug might be specific to certain device models or Expo SDK versions. Please provide details about your environment if reporting the issue to the Expo team.
